Notable changes in 0.28.1 as compared to 0.28
=============================================

General
-------

* Builds from unpacked release archives (created via "git archive
  TAG") should work again.

Build system
------------

* test-web.sh and test-meta.sh should now work on newer versions of OS
  X, and with Homebrew rsync.

* cmd/bup-python's permissions should now respect the umask.


Thanks to (at least)
